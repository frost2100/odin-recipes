        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a recipe I came up with myself. It is great with most Italian dishes. It can be doubled as needed.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>1/2 cup butter, melted</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon garlic salt</ul>
            <ul>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</ul>
            <ul>1/8 teaspoon dried basil</ul>
            <ul>1/8 teaspoon dried thyme</ul>
            <ul>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
            <ul>1 tablespoon grated parmesean cheese</ul>
            <ul>1 loaf french bread, halved lengthwise</ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F</ol>
            <ol>In a small bowl, mix butter, garlic salt, rosemary, basil, thyme, garlic powder, and Parmesean cheese</ol>
            <ol>Spread each half of the French bread with equal portions of the butter mixture. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.</ol>
            <ol>Place bread halves, crusts down, on a medium baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly browned.</ol>
