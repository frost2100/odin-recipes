        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I never knew how to make good meatballs until I found this recipe. I normally make mine with just ground beef and they still taste great. I've used the combination of pork, beef and veal and they are equally good. Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety...it really does make a difference.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>1 pound ground beef</ul>
            <ul>1/2 pound ground veal</ul>
            <ul>1/2 pound ground pork</ul>
            <ul>2 garlic cloves, minced</ul>
            <ul>2 eggs</ul>
            <ul>1 cup grated Romano cheese</ul>
            <ul>1 1/2 tablespoons chopped parsley</ul>
            <ul>salt and pepper to taste</ul>
            <ul>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</ul>
            <ul>1 1/2 cup lukewarm water</ul>
            <ul>1 cup olive oil</ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>Combine beef,veal, and pork in a large bowl</ol>
            <ol>Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper</ol>
            <ol>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add water 1/2 cup at a time. Mixture should be very moist but hold its shape if rolled into balls</ol>
            <ol>Shape into meatballs</ol>
            <ol>Heat olive oil in large skillet and fry meatballs in batches</ol>
            <ol>When meatballs are brown and slightly crisp, remove from oil and drain on paper towel</ol>
